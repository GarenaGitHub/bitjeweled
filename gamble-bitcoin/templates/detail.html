				You'll need to pay <strong>0.005 bitcoins</strong> to do so, as
				required by our embedding algorithm, and you are also invited to tip

				In case you are curious, we are waiting for a transaction to occur
				in the Bitcoin network to the addresses <span id="ladd1">.</span> and
				<span id="radd1">.</span>. This will embed the document's digest in
				the blockchain permanently.

			<h3>Congratulations!</h3>
			<p>This document's digest was successfully embedded in the
				Bitcoin blockchain. It is now permanently certified and proven to
				exist since the transaction was confirmed.</p>
			<p id="tx"></p>
			<p>If you want to confirm the document's existence manually,
				follow this steps:
			<ul>
				<li>Calculate your document's SHA256 digest</li>
				<li>Open the transaction link above.</li>
				<li>The digest is embedded as the data payload of the two
					addresses receiving money in that transaction.</li>
				<li>The two addresses' Hash 160, when joined together, form the
					document's digest. Check them at <span id="ladd2">.</span> and <span
					id="radd2">.</span>.
				</li>
				<li>Alternatively you can check the Output Scripts of the
					transaction, which perpetuate the digest in the Bitcoin
					blockchain.</li>
